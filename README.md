# Introduction to Gadi for Bioinformatics Analysis 

Lecture notes for introduction to Gadi workshop hosted by NCI, Research School of Biology, and Biological Data Science Institute 

---

Gadi is Australiaâ€™s most powerful CPI-based research supercomputer, a highly parallel cluster comprising more than 250,000 processor cores on different types of compute nodes. Gadi accommodates various tasks, from running climate models to genome sequencing, from designing molecules to astrophysical modelling.

This workshop is designed for researchers who would like to move their workload onto a more powerful platform. Gadi will provide you the opportunity to do higher throughput analyses in shorter time periods.

During the workshop, you will find hands-on examples to demonstrate a bioinformatics workflow on Gadi supercomputer. Swing by by to join the session and afternoon tea with nibbles are provided.
